#Local-Kernel-Alignment-Based-Multi-view-Clustering-Using-ELM
The contributions of this study can be summarized as follows:
(a) This study proposes a general multi-view clustering approach which com-
bines multiple views generated by ELM random feature mapping on original
single-view dataset. Each view corresponds to a different value of hidden-layer
nodes.

(b) This study exploits the properties of the local kernel alignment of con-
structed views and proposes an ELM-based multiple kernel clustering algorithm
with local kernel alignment maximization.

(c) This study presents state-of-the-art clustering results on 10 datasets,
including two datasets used in practical face recognition tasks.
